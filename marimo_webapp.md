# Create a WebAssembly + GitHub Pages Template

But not working.
From marimo https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo-gh-pages-template.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

To test the export process, run `.github/scripts/build.py` from the root directory.

```bash
uv run .github/scripts/build.py
```

This will export all notebooks in a folder called `_site/` in the root directory. Then to serve the site, run:

```bash
python -m http.server -d _site
```

This will serve the site at `http://localhost:8000`.
